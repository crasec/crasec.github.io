I am an Associate Professor in the [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](https://infosec.sjtu.edu.cn/index.aspx) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), China. Prior to joining SJTU, I was a Lecturer (aka Assistant Professor) in the Department of Software Systems and Cybersecurity at Monash University, Australia. Before that, I worked as a Research Fellow at Monash University and CSIRO, Australia. 

My research interest centers on cryptography and data privacy, particularly on provably secure cryptosystems against physical attacks, privacy-preserving technology in cloud and blockchain. My work has appeared in leading conferences and journals, including ACM CCS, NDSS, USENIX Security, EUROCRYPT, ASIACRYPT, PKC, ESORICS, IEEE TDSC, and DCC. Iâ€™ve led or participated in multiple national research projects, including key and general programs from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC).

I was honored with the CACR Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Award in 2019, and in 2024, received the CIE Natural Science Award (Second Prize) and the CACR Cryptographic Innovation Award (Second Prize). I currently serve as a committee member and secretary of the Technical Committee on AI and Big Data Security under the CACR, an executive member of the Technical Committee on Computer Security under the CCF, and a member of the Cyberspace Security Technical Committee under the CIE. I also serve on the program committees of international conferences such as ACM CCS, ASIACRYPT, ASIACCS, ACISP, and ISC.
