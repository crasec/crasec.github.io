I am an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. Prior to joining SJTU, I was a Lecturer (aka Assistant Professor) in the Department of Software Systems and Cybersecurity at Monash University, Australia. Before that, I worked as a Research Fellow at Monash University and CSIRO, Australia. My research interest centers on cryptography and data privacy, particularly on provably secure cryptosystems against physical attacks, privacy-preserving technology in cloud and blockchain.
