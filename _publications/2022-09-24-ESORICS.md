Mixing protocols serve as a promising solution to the unlinkability in blockchains. They work by hiding one transaction among a set of transactions and enjoy the advantage of high compatibility with the underlying system. However, due to the inherent public addresses of the blockchains built on the account-based model, the unlinkability is highly restricted to non-confidential transactions. In this paper, we propose MixCT, a mixing service for confidential payment systems built from homomorphic commitment in the account-based model. We provide an efficient instantiation of MixCT by the Pedersen commitment and the one-out-of-many proof. The evaluation results show that MixCT introduces a small cost for its users while being highly compatible with the underlying blockchain.
